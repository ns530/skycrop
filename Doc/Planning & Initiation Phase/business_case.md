## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Opportunity

Sri Lankan paddy farmers collectively manage over 1 million hectares of paddy fields, contributing Rs. 190 billion annually to the national economy. However, they face critical challenges: unpredictable yields, inefficient resource management, climate vulnerability, and lack of scientific decision-making tools. Traditional farming methods result in an estimated 20-30% productivity loss due to suboptimal water and fertilizer application, delayed pest intervention, and inadequate disaster response.

### The Solution

**SkyCrop** is an AI-powered, satellite-based agricultural monitoring platform that transforms how paddy farmers manage their fields. By leveraging free Earth observation satellites (Sentinel-2, Landsat) and advanced machine learning, SkyCrop provides real-time crop health monitoring, precision agriculture recommendations, yield predictions, and disaster impact assessments—all through an intuitive web and mobile interface.

### The Business Value

**For Farmers:**
- **15-25% yield increase** through optimized resource management
- **20-30% reduction in water costs** via precision irrigation
- **15-20% reduction in fertilizer costs** through targeted application
- **Faster insurance claims** with quantified disaster damage data
- **Scientific decision-making** replacing guesswork

**For Agricultural Sector:**
- Enhanced national food security through improved productivity
- Environmental sustainability through reduced chemical runoff
- Data-driven policy making for agricultural development
- Foundation for digital agriculture transformation in Sri Lanka

**For Academic Institution:**
- Showcase of cutting-edge precision agriculture research
- Potential for international publication and recognition
- Technology transfer opportunity to public/private sector

## 1. BUSINESS PROBLEM STATEMENT

### 1.1 Current Situation

**Context:**
- Sri Lanka has approximately **1.05 million hectares** of paddy cultivation (Dept. of Census & Statistics, 2024)
- Over **1.8 million farming families** depend on paddy farming for livelihood
- Paddy production contributes **1.7% to national GDP** (Rs. 190 billion annually)
- Average farm size: 0.5 - 1.5 hectares (small-scale farmers)

**Critical Problems Identified:**

#### Problem 1: Lack of Real-Time Crop Health Monitoring
**Current State:**
- Farmers rely on visual inspection (walking through fields)
- Health issues detected only when visible symptoms appear (often too late)
- No scientific measurement of vegetation health
- Large fields difficult to monitor consistently

**Impact:**
- Delayed intervention in pest/disease outbreaks
- 10-15% yield loss due to late problem detection
- Inefficient labor allocation for field monitoring

#### Problem 2: Inefficient Water & Fertilizer Management
**Current State:**
- Water application based on schedule, not actual plant needs
- Fertilizer applied uniformly across entire field
- No data on spatial variation in crop health
- Over-application in some areas, under-application in others

**Impact:**
- 30-40% water wastage in irrigated areas
- Rs. 5,000-10,000 wasted on excess fertilizer per hectare per season
- Environmental pollution from chemical runoff
- Reduced soil health over time

#### Problem 3: Unpredictable Yield & Poor Market Planning
**Current State:**
- No scientific yield prediction methods
- Farmers estimate harvest based on experience/guesswork
- Buyers/mills unable to plan procurement
- Price volatility due to supply uncertainty

**Impact:**
- Farmers sell at unfavorable prices (lack of negotiation power)
- Food supply chain inefficiencies
- Market speculation and price manipulation
- Rs. 10,000-20,000 potential income loss per farmer per season

#### Problem 4: Inadequate Disaster Impact Assessment
**Current State:**
- After floods/droughts, damage assessment is manual and subjective
- No scientific quantification of crop loss
- Delayed insurance claims (3-6 months typical)
- Disputes between farmers and insurance companies

**Impact:**
- Rs. 2-5 billion annual losses from natural disasters (uninsured)
- Farmer debt due to delayed compensation
- Discouraged insurance adoption (only 15% farmers insured)
- Mental stress and financial hardship

#### Problem 5: Information Asymmetry & Knowledge Gap
**Current State:**
- Farmers lack access to timely, localized agricultural information
- Extension officer ratio: 1:1000 farmers (insufficient coverage)
- Weather forecasts generic, not field-specific
- Agricultural advisories broadcast-style, not personalized

**Impact:**
- Poor decision-making leading to suboptimal outcomes
- Vulnerability to climate change
- Slow adoption of best practices
- Digital divide between urban and rural agriculture

### 1.2 Problem Quantification

| **Problem** | **Annual Economic Impact** | **Affected Farmers** |
|-------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Delayed health monitoring | Rs. 15-20 billion (15% yield loss) | 1.8M |
| Water/fertilizer inefficiency | Rs. 8-12 billion | 1.2M (irrigated areas) |
| Poor yield predictions | Rs. 5-8 billion (price volatility) | 1.8M |
| Disaster damage uncertainty | Rs. 2-5 billion (uninsured losses) | 500K (disaster-prone areas) |
| Information gap | Rs. 10-15 billion (opportunity cost) | 1.8M |
| **TOTAL ANNUAL IMPACT** | **Rs. 40-60 billion** | **1.8M farmers** |

### 1.3 Root Cause Analysis

**Why do these problems persist?**

1. **Technology Gap:** Lack of affordable, accessible precision agriculture tools
2. **Data Scarcity:** No systematic crop monitoring data collection
3. **Cost Barriers:** Commercial satellite imagery too expensive (Rs. 50,000-100,000 per image)
4. **Complexity:** Existing GIS tools require technical expertise
5. **Digital Literacy:** Limited smartphone/computer skills in rural areas
6. **Infrastructure:** Inconsistent internet connectivity
7. **Awareness:** Farmers unaware of satellite-based agriculture solutions

### 1.4 Consequences of Inaction

If these problems remain unaddressed:

**Short-term (1-2 years):**
- Continued 15-25% productivity gap vs. optimal yields
- Environmental degradation from resource mismanagement
- Farmer income stagnation
- Increased farmer debt (currently 60% farmers in debt)

**Medium-term (3-5 years):**
- Youth migration away from agriculture (sustainability crisis)
- Food security risks during climate events
- Increased food imports (Rs. 100+ billion rice imports potential)
- Loss of agricultural land to urbanization

**Long-term (5+ years):**
- Sri Lanka loses rice self-sufficiency status
- Rural economic collapse in farming communities
- Increased urban poverty from rural migration
- Environmental crisis (water scarcity, soil degradation)

### 1.5 Call to Action

**The problem is clear, quantified, and urgent.** A technology solution that democratizes access to satellite-based precision agriculture is not just beneficial—it's essential for the sustainability of Sri Lankan paddy farming and national food security.

- Current revenue: Rs. 120,000/hectare/season
- Water cost: Rs. 25,000/season (irrigated areas)
- Fertilizer cost: Rs. 20,000/season
- Labor cost: Rs. 15,000/season
- 2 seasons per year (Maha + Yala)

**Per Season Benefits:**
1. **Yield Increase:** 4,000 kg × 18% × Rs. 30 = **Rs. 21,600**
2. **Water Savings:** Rs. 25,000 × 23% = **Rs. 5,750**
3. **Fertilizer Savings:** Rs. 20,000 × 15% = **Rs. 3,000**
4. **Labor Savings:** Rs. 15,000 × 50% (field scouting) = **Rs. 7,500**
5. **Better Pricing:** Rs. 120,000 × 5% = **Rs. 6,000**
6. **Reduced Loss:** Rs. 120,000 × 10% = **Rs. 12,000**

**Total Benefit Per Season:** Rs. 55,850  
**Total Benefit Per Year (2 seasons):** **Rs. 111,700**

#### Sensitivity Analysis

| **Scenario** | **Yield Gain** | **Cost Savings** | **Total Annual Benefit** | **Probability** |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------|

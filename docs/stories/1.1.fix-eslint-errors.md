# Story 1.1: Fix ESLint Errors

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** Frontend Developer,
**I want** to fix all 232 ESLint errors in the SkyCrop frontend,
**so that** the codebase follows consistent coding standards and improves maintainability.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All ESLint errors are resolved without introducing new warnings
2. Code follows the established ESLint configuration rules
3. No functionality is broken by the fixes
4. `npm run lint` passes with zero errors and warnings
5. Changes maintain existing code patterns and architecture
6. Fixes maintain <5s load times by not introducing performance regressions or bundle size increases
7. Offline capability is preserved, with no disruption to cached data display or offline indicators
8. Accessibility features remain intact, leveraging ESLint's jsx-a11y rules for low-literacy farmers
9. Mobile-first design considerations are maintained, ensuring responsive layouts and touch targets

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Analyze current ESLint configuration and error types
  - [ ] Review eslint.config.mjs settings
  - [ ] Categorize the 232 errors by type (TS config, parsing, etc.)
- [ ] Fix TypeScript project configuration issues
  - [ ] Update parser options for TypeScript files
  - [ ] Fix module resolution settings
- [ ] Fix parsing errors in source files
  - [ ] Address import/export issues
  - [ ] Fix syntax errors flagged by ESLint
- [ ] Apply consistent code formatting
  - [ ] Fix indentation and spacing issues
  - [ ] Apply consistent quote usage
- [ ] Verify all fixes
  - [ ] Run `npm run lint` to confirm zero errors
  - [ ] Test that application still builds and runs

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- ESLint config: `frontend/eslint.config.mjs`
- Source files: `frontend/src/` directory
- Build scripts: `frontend/package.json` scripts section

### Testing Standards
- Run `npm run lint` to check for ESLint errors
- Ensure no new warnings are introduced
- Verify application builds successfully after changes
- Test critical user flows to ensure no functionality regression

### Technical Context
- ESLint v9.0.0 with TypeScript support
- Flat config format (eslint.config.mjs)
- Strict rules enabled for code quality
- Integration with Prettier for formatting
- Performance constraints: Fixes must not increase bundle size or impact <5s load times; avoid heavy dependencies
- Offline capability: Preserve existing offline indicators and cached data display mechanisms
- Accessibility: Utilize jsx-a11y rules to ensure support for low-literacy farmers with clear, actionable feedback
- Mobile-first design: Maintain touch targets (44px minimum) and responsive layouts
